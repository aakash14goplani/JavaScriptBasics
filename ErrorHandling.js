The Undefined Variable error is thrown when a reference to a variable or object is made in code 
that either doesnâ€™t exist, or is outside the scope of the executing code.

1. All JavaScript error objects are descendants of the Error object, or an inherited object therein.
2. The ReferenceError object is inherited from the Error object.
3. The Undefined Variable error is a specific type of ReferenceError object.

/*
Error thrown when a variable/function is referenced that is not defined
console.log("ReferenceError => " + a);
console.log("ReferenceError => " + abc());

since var is declared but not initialized it will throw undefined
var a;
console.log("ReferenceError => " + a);
function abc() {}
console.log("ReferenceError => " + abc());

var abc = "abc";
function innerScope() {
    console.log("Parent variable in innerScope: " + abc);
    var pqr = "pqr";
    xyz = "xyz";
    return "1";
}
console.log("Can access abc: " + abc);
console.log("Can access innerScope function: " + innerScope());
console.log("Can access innerScope global variable: " + xyz + ", window.xyz: " + window.xyz);
console.log("Cannot access innerScope variable: " + pqr);
